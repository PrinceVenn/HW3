What is the difference between a for loop and a while loop?

A "while" loop will check if the condition is true, and if it is true, will continue until it is no longer true.
A "for" loop does the same thing as a "while" loop, but it condenses everything into one line.

What are the four parts of a for loop? What do they do?

You have var that gives value to a term, x =/</> something so you know when the parameter has been met,
the part of the function that shows how the variable changes, and the actual code that is being used in the function.

What does "nested" mean in the context of nested loops?

Nested means a loop that is repeated or repeating inside of a currently repeating loop.
